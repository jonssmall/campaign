                            Ward One needs fresh leadership and a community first approach to Toms River Township. I am
                            committed to
                            bringing that fresh leadership and community first approach to the Toms River Township
                            Council.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We all love the Shore and the Bay. We know they need to be protected. Yet now, we must also
                            factor in the
                            cutbacks in funding the Federal Government has recently implemented. I will be the voice
                            advocating for
                            Ward One with the State Government. We must secure the funds and plans that we need to guard
                            our homes
                            and businesses. The livelihood of many businesses and billions of dollars in revenue is at
                            stake. Billions more
                            in shore community property values and Municipal tax revenue may also be lost.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I will insist on a transparent government. Not only by increasing accessibility to Council
                            meetings, but I will
                            ensure that the public portion allows, enough time to hear Toms River Township residents
                            speak. All major
                            projects must be discussed openly and described clearly to residents. Very often residents
                            feel their voices
                            have not been counted before decisions are made which affect them.

                            A background in finance has shown me how important it is to control budgets and the revenue
                            that support
                            the services of our town. I will work to ensure that Toms River Township's budget and taxes
                            reflect the views
                            of the residents.

                                We have to promote and support local business in Ward One on both sides of the Bay.

                            Outside of Ward One, we should look to develop Downtown Toms River as a community and
                            business friendly
                            environment that will attract people from all of Toms River Township. We cannot afford to
                            return to the
                            stagnant policies of past administrations. No large buildings that would overwhelm the town.
                            I will look into
                            LLC purchases that are turned into summer rentals. These rentals cause a variety of
                            problems, such as late
                            night noise and overburdened parking on our streets. Open space to walk and play is
                            essential to developing
                            and maintaining our community.

                            I will support our police department as an independent force. We need to reconnect and
                            recognize the
                            community relations and open discussion we enjoyed with our Police Department in the past.

                            As a full time Councilman, I will be responsive to all of the concerns Ward One Residents
                            have. Not only will I
                            attend community, committee and Council meetings regularly, I will maintain an open door to
                            every Ward One
                            resident.
