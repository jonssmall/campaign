                                    return to the stagnant policies of past administrations. No large buildings that would overwhelm the town.
                                    I will look into LLC purchases that are turned into summer rentals. These rentals cause a variety of
                                    problems, such as late night noise and overburdened parking on our streets. Open space to walk and play is
